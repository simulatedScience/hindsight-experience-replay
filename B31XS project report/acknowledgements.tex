\section{Acknowledgements}
I thank my brother for providing a more capable laptop to run the experiments on.
Franz Bethke sent me the ChemEx data as well as a piece of code to load that data and Thomas KÃ¼hne helped me to report the correct units used in the dataset to provide more complete information.
Testing my variation of Adam would likely not have been possible without the example of a custom optimizer in Tensorflow by Evan Walters on \href{https://github.com/evanatyourservice}{GitHub}.
% Andrea Walther and Franz Bethke for continous feedback throughout working on the thesis
% Varadarajan for confirming that the dataset error was also in his master thesis.
